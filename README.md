## TL;DR (Too Legendary; Didn’t Read)

Open the page, behold a hypnotic galaxy of gradients,  
get **_instant existential dread_** because the year is already 57 % gone.  
Close laptop. Sob. Repeat daily for maximum productivity.

## Genesis of the Idea ⏳

> _“What if a progress bar could single-handedly destroy my sense of time,  
> motivate me to finish my thesis, and look fabulous while doing it?”_  
> — **Me, 3 AM, caffeinated beyond mortal limits**

This project began as a humble doodle on a napkin during a cosmic alignment
between **New Year’s Eve** and an inexplicable urge to learn CSS `@keyframes`.
One thing led to another, and now we have:

* **A kaleidoscopic background** that makes unicorn tears look dull.  
* **A bar that shimmers like a disco ball** on roller-skates.  
* **Percentage readouts** big enough to be seen from the ISS.  

If time is money, this repo is a **quantum hedge-fund** for your attention.
